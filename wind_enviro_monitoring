## esp sensibles
- sensitive species
- bird collisions
- bat collisions
Birds of all species can collide with wind turbines, but those that reproduce in small numbers are particularly vulnerable. This includes most raptors, which have large territories and are often found in small numbers, even during migration. Other species that are at risk include gulls and terns, which are found near coasts, and cranes and storks, which are less common.

Migratory bats are also particurlarly vulnerable such as the ([Nathusius' Pipistrelle ](https://youtu.be/ImYYqXYfTl0?si=AdOOy4fumnpiI9bx) in Europe. This French article shows which species are the most sensivitve based on acoustic activity data recorded at height from measuring masts [(Roemer et al., 2017)](https://docs.wind-watch.org/Roemer.j.biocon.2017.09.pdf)

## Durr
- Durr
- Dürr
A German scientist, Tobias Dürr, has been collecting data on bird mortality at wind turbines in Europe for many years. This data is not complete, but it provides valuable insights into the species that are most at risk from wind turbines. The website [Landesamt für Umwelt Brandenburg](https://lfu.brandenburg.de/lfu/de/aufgaben/natur/artenschutz/vogelschutzwarte/arbeitsschwerpunkt-entwicklung-und-umsetzung-von-schutzstrategien/auswirkungen-von-windenergieanlagen-auf-voegel-und-fledermaeuse/) makes data avaliable for download as Excel spreadsheets (at the bottom of the page).

Another published article, English this time, analyses at the world wide scale the vulnerability of differents groups of animals. Those which tends to fly below 30 m above ground level or migrate are arguably more at risk of collision. [(Thaxter et al., 2017)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.0829)

Beyond the simple number of birds killed, it is important to consider the mortality rates relative to the populations of each species and their conservation status. This is because the impact of wind turbines on bird populations will vary depending on the size of the population, the number of wind turbines, and the conservation status of the species. This is issue is discussed in the article of the French journal "Eolien & Biodiversité" de 2022 (page 23) => [https://www.calameo.com/books/0063425990f6eb7c24b96](https://www.calameo.com/books/0063425990f6eb7c24b96)

## Le protocole national 2018
- French protocole 
- French national protocole 2018
- standardised protocole in France
- protocole France
In France, a minimum set of practices for the research of birds and bats impacted by wind turbines has been established and validated. The first version of the protocol was published in 2015, and a more complete version was published in 2018. The second version is available for download [here](https://eolien-biodiversite.com/IMG/pdf/protocole_de_suivi_revision_2018.pdf). 
The main requirements are as follows: :
* **The number of visits**
    * at least 20 visits per year 
    * between mid-May and the end of October (from week 20 to 43)
* **The areas to search for carcasses**
    * A 100 m x 100 m square or concentric circles with a radius equal to the length of the blade (minimum 50 m)
    * Transect lines spaced 5 to 10 m apart, depending on the condition of the ground and vegetation
* **The tests**
    * a test enabling to assess the seacher efficiency
    * a test enabling to assess the local persistence of the carcasses (scavenger presence and farming practices)
* Continuous recording of bat activity at nacelle height for a large part of the season
**The objective is to determine the real mortality rates by using statistical models to estimate them from the observed raw mortality on the ground.**

## formule : Huso
- Huso
Huso et al. (2010) consider a mortality globally constant but with their approach the probability of removal at the middle of the interval between two consecutive visits is not equal to the average probability of persistence of a carcass.
$$N = \frac{C}{d * p * ê} * A$$   with $$p = t * (1-exp^-I/l) / l$$ 
even if the duration of persistence follows a negative exponantiel function.
Nevertheless, the Huso models are based on north american data where persistence is usually longer than found in Europe. 
The biaises are therefore more important with this approach when peristence is short (a few days only).

## formule : Jones
- Jones
The model from Jones et al. (2009) is based on the following hypothesis :
* the mortality rate is considered globally constant on the intervall of consecutive searches ;
* the duration of persistence of a carcass follows a negative exponantiel function, the persistence rate is calculated as Tm (average duration in days) ;
* the probability of the average removal on the complete interval (when animals can impacted at the beginning or the end of the interval) can be approximated  by the probability of removal at the middle of the interval.
Jones uses the notion of the effective interval for calculating the corrective factor ê which corresponds to the ratio between the duration before that 99 % of carcasses are removed and the duration of the interval. Indeed, it is quite logic that when the interval is long then the persistance ratio gets closer to 0. The effective interval corresponds to the duration for which the persistance ratio is equal to 1 % (100 - 99 %).
The average effective interval, Î is equal to : - log(0,01) x tm. With I having the minimal value between I et Î, noted ê.

## formule : Erickson
- Erickson
The Erickson's estimator (2000) used to be frequently used in France (previously to 2018). This test tends to underestimate the data for the short persistane rates but not for the long ones. This result is also considered due to the constant sampling effort. The formula takes into account the frequency of the visits but not the average time of intervals (time in-between visits). It considers an explonantial decrease of the removal time of carcasses which can be found during  the visits following the first one without findings.

It has been shown that there is not only one relevant or valid formula for all cases (long or short persistance etc...). Huso's formula (2010) is often used by dfault but it alo has its limits of validity when few carcasses have been found. It is is recommended to start using the open source R Package "GenEst" which Huso has developped with Dalthorp et al. => [https://www.usgs.gov/software/genest-a-generalized-estimator-mortality](https://www.usgs.gov/software/genest-a-generalized-estimator-mortality)

## formule : EoA
In this particular case, the different fomrulas cannot make a conclusive estimation of the real mortality. Another approach is required : the one which questions the **_credibility_** of the different paramaters of the monitoring (rather than the probability or the level of confidence based on a posterior distribution). Huso and Dalthorp have developped another open source software package called _**Evidence of Absence**_ which can be downloaded from the [USGS website
](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/ds1055). It works on R 4.0 or more using various packages and this free stats programme ["JAGS"](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/).

In addition, experts from the american ecological consultancy firm "Western Ecosystems Technology" have developed an extension which uses more covariables in order to adjust even more the estimates. More details available [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.914754v3.full.pdf)

## Le test de persistance
- persistence
- persistence rate
- persistence test
- interval
This consists in leaving on site various ploys or trial carcasses (frozen mice or rats) on searched areas in order to assess the persistance in time at various periods of the year (May and September for instance). The French protocole 2018 requires to use at least 3 per wind turbine for each sesssion, but it is recommended to increase this number to cover all types of visibility. In France, the persistance is relatively short (< 3 days) in open field when the ploys are left at the same time ; which is in itself a bias compared to the real situtation (relatively randomly distributed in time for a specific period). It is thus relevant to use a result for each specific tested period when making the estimations.

## Le test de détection
A searcher's detection capacity varies a lot depending the visibility conditions, his/her experience, tireness and so on... This test uses trial carcasses or similar objects placed on site in order to check how much of them are found indeed during a standard visit. The results must be tailored to each searcher, visibility class, size class and period of the year. Bad scores, i.e. below 50 %, have to well analysed as they mean that the search is not effective enough or the visibility is too poor.

As an alternative and to improve detection, well-trained dogs are sometimes used because their sense of smell allows them to achieve high scores (>90%). With the development of technology, drones are also being tested. Everything depends on the quality of the images and their post-processing analysis methods. The results obviously vary depending on the size of the carcasses and their visibility in particular (a bat or a goldcrest will be more difficult to detect than a swift or a buzzard, for example).

## La correction surfacique
The [French protocol 2018](https://eolien-biodiversite.com/IMG/pdf/protocole_de_suivi_revision_2018.pdf) requires to cover circle area with the radius corresponding to the leght of the blade. When there is too much crops (wheat, maize, beetroot...), it becomes complicated to search without damaging them. It is then generally admitted to avoid these areas. Presence of cattle can also lead to the same decision. The simplest value corresponds to the proportional searched areas; and more adjusted one is to work out this every 5 or 10 m radius concentric circles (Arnett 2006).

The searches for carcasses are focused on areas with hig visibility only, which often are the platforms or pads and the access roads up to 120 m whenever possible. It usually takes less than 10 min to cover around 20 % of the standardised full plot (100 m square). These quick visits can also be carried out during other types of monitoring such as bird activity surveys or in alternance with standardises visits for all wind turbines in order to increase the frequency. This is particularly relevant for sites with very low persistence.

In parallel of fatality searches, bat activity is also monitored at nacelle height in order to understand better in which weather conditions bats are active throughout the seasons. This has been useful to work out bat curtailment plans specifically for each site.

After having filtered out noises, all the remaining sound files are counted and then correlated to weather conditions (wind speed and temperature at least). Most of these bat passes are recorded for wind speed below 6 m/s (see this French study compiling 3 years of monitoring at height on measuring masts [Labouré et al. 2020](http://www.museum-bourges.net/documents/laboure_m._et_al._-_analyse_activite_des_cs_en_fonction_meteo.pdf)). Au-delà de 8 m/s, l'activité des chiroptères résiduelle est très faible, et correspond à des grosses espèces migratrices (noctules notamment). L'activité des chiroptères augmente avec la température, particulièrement entre 10°C et 25°C.

In France and more recently, academics from the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris have published this article [(Barré et al., 2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969723000190) going deeper into which covariables may influence bat activity at in order to elaborate tailored bat curailment algorithms.

In the USA, other academics have studied at the same time the bat activity using infrared cameras within the rotor swept area : [Goldenberg et al. 2021(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.7388).

The most critical period for bat mortality is late summer and early autumn, particularly between August and October. Here are the main reasons:
- Autumn migration: This period corresponds to the migration of bats to their hibernation and mating sites (swarming).
- Peak activity: Chiropterological activity is highest during this period, thus increasing the risk of collision with wind turbines.
- Juvenile dispersal: Late summer and early autumn correspond to the juvenile dispersal cycle, which are particularly vulnerable and inexperienced.
- Reserve building: Bats intensify their hunting activity to build up their reserves in anticipation of hibernation.
- Favorable weather conditions: This period often offers favorable weather conditions for bat activity (mild temperatures, low winds).
It is important to note that a secondary mortality peak can also be observed in spring (May), corresponding to the emergence from hibernation and spring migration.

Beyond the comparisons, **the main objective is to significantly reduce mortality through various solutions and measures that consist of optimizing wind turbine curtailments at risk periods and during critical situations (animals flying too close to the blades).** Quite basicly, this takes the form of the presence of "monitors" or sentinels in the field who can quickly trigger a shutdown of the turbines (with a mobile phone application or an emergency call for example).
Technological advances also allow the development of engineering solutions based on remote video and/or audio detection. The challenge is to detect the bird early enough to slow down the rotation of the blades using sophisticated algorithms; and bats with sensitive, weather-resistant microphones.
Whether it's with high-tech cameras, radars or microphones, engineers are trying to improve their automatic detection and analysis capabilities of their various systems. These are tested in real situations and verified through monitoring controlled by the State's decentralized services.

Here are concrete examples of measures to create or restore habitats suitable for the Red Kite, which can be implemented outside the area directly impacted by a wind farm project, to compensate for potential losses:

**Restoration of permanent grasslands:**
Conversion of arable land to grasslands: Transforming intensively cultivated fields into permanent grasslands, rich in floristic diversity and favorable to populations of small mammals (voles, wood mice), which constitute a significant part of the Red Kite's diet.
Extensive grassland management: Implementing extensive grazing with animals (cattle, sheep) or late mowing, to maintain diverse herbaceous vegetation and a structure favorable to the presence of the Red Kite's prey. Avoiding the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
Creation of flower meadows: Sowing mixtures of varied seeds, including local and melliferous species, to promote biodiversity and attract insects, which also serve as food for some of the Red Kite's prey.

**Planting and management of hedges and groves:**
Planting hedgerows: Creating linear hedgerows composed of varied local species (trees and shrubs), providing refuge and nesting areas for the Red Kite's prey, as well as ecological corridors for their movements.
Creation of groves: Planting small groups of trees and shrubs, creating shaded and resting areas for the Red Kite, and promoting the presence of insects and birds.
Sustainable management of hedges and groves: Implementing gentle and respectful management of these elements, avoiding overly frequent pruning and promoting natural regeneration.

**Improvement of wetlands:**
Restoration of wetlands: Restoring marshes, ponds, or wet meadows, which are important habitats for many Red Kite prey species, such as amphibians and water birds.
Creation of ponds: Developing ponds or small areas of stagnant water, which attract insects and amphibians, and provide water points for the Red Kite.

**Agri-environmental measures:**
Implementation of agri-environmental and climate measures (AECMs): Encouraging farmers to adopt agricultural practices favorable to biodiversity, such as non-use of pesticides, late mowing of grasslands, or maintenance of landscape elements (hedges, isolated trees).
Conservation management contracts: Concluding contracts with landowners to implement specific management measures aimed at promoting Red Kite habitats.

**Concrete example**:
As part of a wind farm project impacting a Red Kite foraging area, a compensation measure could consist of restoring an old wet meadow located a few kilometers from the site. This restoration could include dredging a pond, planting hedges, and implementing extensive grazing. This measure would create a new attractive hunting habitat for the Red Kite, thus compensating for the loss of the initial habitat.
It is crucial to note that these measures must be defined in consultation with local stakeholders (farmers, landowners, nature conservation associations) and taking into account the specific characteristics of the territory. The expertise of ecologists and ornithologists is essential to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of compensation measures.

Despite my attempts, it was not good enough. The next step involves reading the various quoted references... or you do not want to go further and shut this window ; )
In any case, I invite you to look into this fairly complexe issue but quite major in the context of climate chage and biodiversity crisis. You may find interesting to browse these other web sites:
