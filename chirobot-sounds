## techno
- technology
- listening
- detector
- heterodyne
- frequency division
- time expansion
Bats emit sounds at frequencies that are above our audible range for the most part, called ultrasonic. Technologies have been developed to allow us to "hear" them:
* **Heterodyne** : two signals of different frequencies, called the input signal and the local signal, are mixed in a device called a mixer. The mixer produces an output signal whose frequency is the sum or the difference of the two input frequencies. When the two signals are mixed, the output signal has a frequency equal to the difference of the two input frequencies. This frequency is called the beat frequency. The beat frequency is then amplified and demodulated. Demodulation consists of converting the beat frequency into an audible signal. It is listened to live but only a reduced range of frequencies can be heard at a time (approximately 5 kHz).

* **Frequency division** : the microphone signal is then sent to a filter. The filter separates the different frequencies of the ultrasonic signal. The different frequencies can be heard simultaneously but with a muffled sound that crackles.
* **Time expansion** works by sampling the audio signal at a frequency higher than the normal sampling frequency. This gives the audio signal greater temporal resolution, which allows the signal to be slowed down without losing data. In France, the sound is usually slowed down 10 times. A clear sound is heard but with a delay because it requires recording the live signal to be replayed.

## sons types
Bats have been using echolocation for millions of years to navigate in the dark. They regularly emit **"sonar"** type sounds to scan their immediate environment and "see" any obstacles or insects in the air. However, they are not blind and their sense of sight is secondary.
Other sounds are used for communication with their fellow bats, either in their roosts (such as between mother and offspring) where they are longer and lower in frequency, or when interacting with each other in flight over a hunting ground. These are known as **social calls**.
[![Bat social calls](https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbmsyYjJ6d3FqNWVveGo5eTBiaDQwM2p1MzFzYm54d3h0cnA0NXg0eSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/fU5k7LCUBUBs9Y3ptM/giphy.gif)](https://youtube.com/shorts/eA_8P5fo5NI?feature=share) _Guillaume  Marchais_
Finally, a captured animal will emit distress calls that are almost audible to humans.

## sons types 2
- duration
- peak frequency
- signal
- bandwidth
Here are the main criteria for determining the species of European bats based on the frequencies of their sound emissions, which are used in combination to identify different species of bats.
* **Peak frequency** : the highest frequency of an ultrasonic signal. It is generally expressed in kHz (kilohertz). The peak frequency is an important criterion for identifying bats, as it is often specific to a species or group of species.
* **Bandwidth** : the difference between the peak frequency and the lowest frequency of the ultrasonic signal. It is generally expressed in kHz. Bandwidth is also an important criterion for identifying bats, as it can vary depending on the species and size of the animal.
* **Duration** : of an ultrasonic signal is expressed in milliseconds (ms). Duration is less important than peak frequency or bandwidth, but it can be useful for distinguishing certain species.
* **Rate** : number of pulses per second. It is generally expressed in calls or pulses per second. The rate is a less important criterion than peak frequency or bandwidth, but it can be useful for distinguishing certain species.
* **Signal type** : there are two main types of ultrasonic signals emitted by bats: FM (frequency modulated) signals and FC or QFC (constant or quasi-constant frequency) signals.
	- FM signals are characterized by a frequency that increases rapidly and then decreases suddenly. They are emitted by most insectivorous bats.
	- FC signals are characterized by a constant frequency. They are emitted by fruit-eating and nectar-eating bats, as well as horseshoe bats in France that have a horse-shoe shaped mouth and hang upside down in their roosts.
* **Signal structure** : can be more complex than the simple signal type. For example, FM signals can be composed of several elements or several frequencies.
Identifying bat species based on the frequencies of their sound emissions requires specific training and experience.

## esp haute
Horseshoe bats, which often hang upside down in caves and grottos, emit high-frequency constant frequency (CF) signals (> 80 kHz for the most "audible" harmonic). In heterodyne, their sonar signals are very fast and sharp. Here is an example for the [Lesser horseshoe bat](https://youtube.com/shorts/XgmC_SgB77o) that emits between 15 and 120 kHz:
[![Lesser horseshoe bat heterodyne](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExd3g2N3duc2dhMHg1OHloOW15NG96bGdtM3NjcnJzNW04NXRuNzB5MyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/Qyktulx4HtdOQ89CLw/giphy.gif)](https://youtube.com/shorts/XgmC_SgB77o) _Guillaume Marchais_
In time expansion (x10), the sounds are even sharper:

Their "big brother," the [Greater horseshoe bat](https://youtube.com/shorts/yqe4rqG5m2M) emits similar ultrasonic signals at a lower frequency:

## esp basse
- noctule
- nyctalus
- low frequencies
The larger species are known to emit at lower frequencies for their "sonar" sounds, typically between 8 and 25 kHz (Cestoni's bat and noctules).
In heterodyne, their sounds are rather low-pitched and widely spaced because they often fly at heights above 30 m and over long distances (tens of kilometers).
[![Noctule hunting](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExemwxajF0MHB2M3h3eXRkZGIwNGFnN3R5aDBpMjhjZWZmaTI1M3ZjciZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/7L0SnBtFm5Rz4vjXqZ/giphy.gif)](https://youtube.com/shorts/IbPkGTADIeQ) _Guillaume Marchais (Echo Meter Touch 2)_

In the following example, you can clearly see the difference between two species: the smaller one (Common pipistrelle) emits at higher frequencies than the larger one (Noctule commune):

There are numerous devices that use one or more active or passive technologies. Active devices are used for self-prospecting, while passive devices are placed for one or more nights. Most are standalone, while others can be connected to a smartphone with a dedicated app.
A comparison of active detectors has been compiled over the years by French expert [Michel Barataud](http://ecologieacoustique.fr/wp-content/uploads/Comparatif_detecteurs-manuels_MB.pdf).
For passive detectors, there are models like the Audiomoth from Openacoustic, SMbat from Wildlife Acoustics, and Anabat from Titley scientific.
They are available from French specialized suppliers such as [Biotope](https://leclub-biotope.com/fr/124-materiel-de-terrain-logiciels), [Wildcare](https://www.wildcare.eu/chauves-souris/detecteurs-portatifs.html), and [Jama](https://www.jama.fr/boutique/fr/prise-de-son/detecteurs-chauves-souris/batbox-60).
Alternatively, an associative initiative offers the production of detectors from components in a self-managed collective. The approach is for an informed audience, as it requires delving into detailed documentation [here](https://framagit.org/PiBatRecorderPojects/TeensyRecorders) and spending some time on it... but the reward is at the end with high-quality detectors at a low cost (around 100 € per unit compared to 500 to 1500 € for those directly marketed).

As a first approach, here are the forms and frequencies often encountered for sonar calls used for spatial navigation (no social interaction):

- several inverted comma-shaped signals between 30 and 70 kHz: probably Pipistrelles (Savi's pipistrelle and Schreiber's bent-winged bat possible in the southern half of France).
- several inverted comma-shaped signals between 15 and 30 kHz: probably Serotines or Noctules _(Cestoni's free-tailed bat probable if < 15 kHz and in the southern half of France). Serotine often with an irregular rhythm ("bad jazz drummer") and Noctules sometimes with an alternation of 2 signals ("comma and line").
- several completely horizontal and long signals > 80 kHz (or 55 kHz depending on the devices): Horseshoe bats certain.
- several completely vertical and long signals: probably Myotis (above a body of water: Daubenton's bat possible, if in the Mediterranean then Capaccini's bat).
- 2 alternating repeated signals between 30 and 45 kHz: probably Barbastelle.
- several small S-shaped (sigmoid) comma signals with a "nasal" sound: probable Long-eared bats, grey or brown in general (mountainous if in the mountains obviously ;).
